Federated learning for credit scoring. Investigating privacy, performance and computational overhead

## Federated Lerning

Federated learning is a novel machine learning approach that enables the training of machine learning models using data distributed across multiple devices or locations. This decentralized approach to model training has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and security concerns associated with centralizing large amounts of sensitive data. 

In federated learning, instead of sending data to a central server, local data is used to train a model that is then sent back to a central server to be combined with other models. This approach allows the model to be trained on a large and diverse set of data while minimizing data exposure and maintaining data privacy. Federated learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to unlock the power of distributed data and improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models.

## Privacy concerns in credit scoring

Credit scoring is a critical process in the financial industry that involves evaluating the creditworthiness of an individual or business based on their financial history and other relevant factors. However, this process can raise privacy concerns, as it often involves the collection and use of sensitive personal information.

One of the primary privacy concerns in credit scoring is the potential for discrimination. For example, if credit scoring models rely heavily on factors such as race, gender, or age, it may lead to unfair and discriminatory practices that negatively impact certain groups of people. Additionally, credit scoring models may also unintentionally perpetuate existing biases in the financial industry, such as favoring individuals with established credit histories or those who have access to certain types of financial products.

Another concern is the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive personal information. Credit scoring companies typically collect and store vast amounts of personal and financial data, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and income information. If this data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to identity theft, fraud, and other financial crimes.
